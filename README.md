# BreakingWall-Project

Hi I am Sahil Anower. This is a Swing and AWT based application which is basically a classic brick-breaker game which we used to play long back in our childhood.

## Run Locally

Download the Project Files and keep them in a single folder just as it is.

Go to the project directory and simply run the main.java file.
And you would see the game running live and well.


## Demo
